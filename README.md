# Fuel Efficiency Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting vehicle fuel efficiency (measured in miles per gallon, MPG) using the classic Auto MPG dataset. The project walks through the entire data science workflow and trains a Deep learning Model, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.



## Dataset

The dataset used is the [Auto MPG dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/auto+mpg) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes the following features:

- `mpg`: Miles per gallon (target variable)
- `cylinders`: Number of cylinders
- `displacement`: Engine displacement
- `horsepower`: Engine horsepower
- `weight`: Vehicle weight
- `acceleration`: Time to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph
- `model year`: Year of manufacture
- `origin`: Region of origin
- `car name`: Vehicle name (string, often excluded in modeling)
